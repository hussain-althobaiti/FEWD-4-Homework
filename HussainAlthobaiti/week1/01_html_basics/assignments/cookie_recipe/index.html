<h1>Task</h1>
<p>========================</p>

<p>Your Grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you in this .html document (she's so nice). </p>

<p>She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list).</p>

<p>Your Grandpa happens to be a great Graphic Designer and gave you the following specs to style:</p>

<h1>Cookie Recipe CSS</h1>
<p>=================</p>
<ul>
<li>- The background color for the page is #FFE.</li>
<li>- The color for the text reading "Nutrition Information" is #887</li>
<li>- The link color is #900</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: The border on the page and around the image is black</p>
